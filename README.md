### What I learned

Through this exercise, I got introduced to the services of fontawesome icons.
I further solidified my knowledge on absolute positioning using CSS
I learnt the use of Pseudo elements as seen in the active state on destop view. As well as the use of transform rotate in CSS

This project was carried out with a mobile-first approach. The picture below shows a camparison of the exercise given to the solution I came up with.
